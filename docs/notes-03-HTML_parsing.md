# Parsing Webpage HTML

Scraping the webpage's HTML is a great step, but now, the next thing to do is sort through all of the mess, and create some sort of sense and organization from all the data.

This is where beautiful soup comes in.

To use Beautiful Soup, we have to have it installed, and then imported in our module. Refer to notes-01 and notes-02 for more details.

When using Beautiful Soup, keep in mind that it structures the variable fed into the method "BeautifulSoup" using the given parser type. In our case, our content is an HTML structure, and therefore will use the "html-parser" option
