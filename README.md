# Project 1: Web Scraper

## Summary

This project is to create a tool to extract data from websites. It will consist of the following requirements:

 - Use Git Branches to manage progress

 - Use the libraries Beautiful Soup and/or Scrapy

 - Use multiple classes to create the functionality

 - Use TDD (Test Driven Development) to test the software on a consistent basis

## User Stories

For the software to be viable, there needs to be some scenarios where the software is needed and used. The following are some user stories that may be included in the project at some point. For more information on progress, refer to the [Projects](https://github.com/users/joschp01/projects/1) section on github.
